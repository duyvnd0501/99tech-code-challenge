**Title**: 99Tech Code Challenge - My Solutions

---

### Introduction
"Hello everyone. Today, I want to show you my results for the 99Tech Code Challenge. This project shows my skills in backend development and system design."

### Part 1: Problem 4 (Sum to N)
"First, I solved the summation problem. The goal is to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N.
I wrote three different ways to do this.
The best way uses a **Math Formula**. It is very fast and efficient. It runs in constant time, which means it is fast even for big numbers."

### Part 2: Problem 5 (Product API)
"Next, I built a server for managing Products.
I used **Node.js, TypeScript, and Express**.
I followed **Clean Architecture**. This means I separated the code into different parts: Controller, Service, and Repository. This makes the code easy to read and fix.
I also used **PostgreSQL** for the database and **Docker** to run the app easily.
I wrote **Unit Tests** to make sure the code works correctly."

### Part 3: Problem 6 (Leaderboard Architecture)
"Finally, I designed a Real-time Leaderboard system.
The goal is to show the top 10 players and update the score immediately.
I used **Redis** to store the scores because it is very fast.
I used **WebSockets** to send updates to users right away without reloading the page.
I also added security validation to prevent cheating.
This design makes the system fast, safe, and reliable."

### Conclusion
"In short, this project shows that I can write good code and build strong backend systems. Thank you for listening."
